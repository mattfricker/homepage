        <h2>Technology, Research, and Analysis</h2>
        <p>I deeply enjoy solving puzzles. The problems of today are solved with a variety of skills, but the three that I am most passionate about are research, analytic tradecraft, and technology.</p>
        
        <p>I am currently focused on understanding the web platform, specifically how best practices should evolve in the age of web components, HTTP2, and JavaScript transpilation.</p>
        
        <p>Though I am proficient with HTML, CSS, build processes, and version control, my primary near-term goal is attaining a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript and how its unique qualities can be leveraged to build applications and open-source projects.</p>
